# YelpSQLProject
During my course of "SQL for Data Science" in the end I had to submit an assignment on Yelp data set prepare some data analysis on various questions given by my instructor "Sadie St. Lawrence" who is a AI Strategy Consultant at Accenture. This assignment is the culmination of everything which I have learned.
